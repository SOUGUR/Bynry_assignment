## Functionalities
1. View Pending Requests
Representatives only can view a list of all pending service requests on the Pending Requests page. Each request displays the subject,
description, status and creation date for clarity and ease of access.

2. Resolve a Request
Representatives can then click on the "Mark as Resolved" button to update a request's status to resolved.
Once resolved, the button text dynamically changes to "Resolved", and the button is disabled,
ensuring no duplicate actions are performed.

3. Secure Access
The service request management interface is protected through authentication, allowing only logged-in representatives to view
and manage pending service requests. Unauthorized access is restricted by redirecting users to the home page.

4. Real-Time Updates
The AJAX-based functionality ensures a easy user
experience by dynamically updating the status of requests.

5. User-Friendly Interface
The interface is designed to be intuitive, displaying pending requests in a structured list. Each request includes key details
like the subject, description, and timestamp, making it easy for representatives to act promptly.

6. Dynamic URL Management
The URLs for resolving requests are dynamically generated, ensuring accuracy and reducing potential errors in routing.
